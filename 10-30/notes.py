d-latch
strobe? helps figure out where we want to write?
press to set, don't press to reset?
in RAM, D-latches are used, address, input, read/write pins?

are we getting into assembly?
operations encoded in binary (binary instructions)
addresses in binary
then information we want to write

if:
00 = add
01 = subtract
10 = multiply
11 = divide
00110010
00 = add, 11 = reg3, 00 = reg0, 10 = reg2
so set reg3 to reg0 + reg2
program counter incremented after operation finished?

10001100 means 10 = multiply, 00 = reg0, 11 = reg3, 00 = reg0
set reg0 = reg3 * reg0

von neumann architecture, stored programs

yay loops have happened
functional (declarative) programming vs imperative programming
- imperative based on clearly defined instructions, loops introduced
OOP also exists to support imperative programming
